# Project Context: Philly Fingered

## Overview

**Philly Fingered** is a daily location-guessing game for Philadelphia landmarks. Users must identify 5 different locations each day by tapping on an interactive map, receiving scores based on proximity to the actual locations. The game features sequential location display with smooth animations, shareable score results, and comprehensive test coverage.

**Live Site**: https://briengleason.github.io/philly-fingered/

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js (open-source mapping library)
- **Map Tiles**: CartoDB light_nolabels (no street names/labels)
- **Storage**: localStorage (for daily game state persistence)
- **Configuration**: YAML file for daily locations (`config/locations.yaml`)
- **YAML Parser**: js-yaml (loaded from CDN)
- **Testing**: Custom test framework (browser-based)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (static hosting)

## Core Features

### 1. Interactive Map
- Full-screen map of Philadelphia
- No street names or labels (clean aesthetic)
- Mobile and desktop responsive
- Touch and mouse interaction support
- Viewport resize handling for mobile browsers
- Orientation change support

### 2. Daily Location Guessing Game
- **5 Locations per day** (configurable via `config/locations.yaml`)
- **Sequential display**: Locations appear one at a time
- **Default locations**:
  1. Liberty Bell (🔔)
  2. Independence Hall (🏛️)
  3. Philadelphia Museum of Art (🎨)
  4. Reading Terminal Market (🍕)
  5. City Hall (🏢)
- **Date-based configuration**: Different locations can be set for specific dates
- **Fallback**: Uses default locations if no date-specific config exists

### 3. Sequential Game Flow with Animations
- **One location at a time**: User focuses on single location
- **Fade animations**: Smooth transitions between locations
- **Pulse animation**: Icon pulses to indicate user should tap
- **Next location overlay**: Shows upcoming location with animation
- **Progress indicator**: Shows "Location X of 5"
- **No skipping**: Ensures all locations are played in order

### 4. Scoring System
- **Base Scores**: 0-100 points per location (calculated from distance)
- **Score Multipliers**:
  - Locations 1-2 (id: 0-1): Base score only (no multiplier)
  - Location 3 (id: 2): Base score × 2 (doubled)
  - Locations 4-5 (id: 3-4): Base score × 3 (tripled)
- **Total Score Range**: 0-1000 points (sum of all 5 locations with multipliers: 100 + 100 + 200 + 300 + 300)
- **Distance-based**: Uses Haversine formula to calculate distance
- **Scoring Curve**: Exponential decay (closer = exponentially better score)
  - Formula: `baseScore = 100 * (1 - (distance / MAX_DISTANCE))^1.5`
  - Then multipliers are applied: `finalScore = baseScore × multiplier`
- **Maximum Distance**: 5km (beyond this = 0 points)

### 5. Visual Feedback
- Blue pin (📍) at user's guess location
- Colored icon pin (🔔/🏛️/🎨/🍕/🏢) at actual location
- Dashed line connecting the two points
- Distance label at midpoint of line (in meters)
- Quick score popup on each guess
- Running total score display

### 6. Share Score Functionality
- **Share button**: On completion screen, below score table
- **Emoji-based scoring**: Visual representation of performance
  - 🎯 = Perfect (100)
  - 🏅 = Excellent (95-99)
  - 🏆 = Great (90-94)
  - 🎉 = Good (85-89)
  - ✨ = Nice (80-84)
  - 😁 = Good (75-79)
  - 🤗 = Okay (70-74)
  - Lower scores have appropriate emojis
- **Share message format**:
  ```
  briengleason.github.io/philly-fingered/ January 17
  96🏅 100🎯 95🏅 87🎉 89🎉
  Final score: 467
  ```
- **Clipboard API**: Automatically copies to clipboard
- **Native Share API**: Falls back to clipboard if not available

- **Auto-reset**: New game each day (based on date)
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows which locations are completed
- **Sequential Progression**: Tracks current location index
- **Completion Detection**: Shows completion screen when all 5 locations guessed

### 8. Completion Screen
- **Score table**: Shows all locations with distances and scores
- **Final score**: Total aggregated score
- **Share button**: Allows sharing score with emojis
- **Clean UI**: Organized display of all game results

### 9. User Interface
- **Current Location Panel**: Top (mobile) / Right side (desktop)
  - Current location icon and name
  - Progress indicator (Location X of 5)
  - Running total score
- **Game Instructions**: Initial guidance for first-time users

- **Browser Console Commands**: Manual reset methods
- **Test Suite**: 65+ automated tests

## Key Functions

### Distance Calculation
```javascript
function calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)
```
- Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance between lat/lng coordinates
- Returns distance in meters
- Accounts for Earth's curvature

### Score Calculation
```javascript
function calculateScore(distance, maxDistance = 5000)
function applyScoreMultiplier(score, locationId)
```
- Base Formula: `100 * (1 - (distance / maxDistance))^1.5`
- Exponential decay curve
- Closer guesses get disproportionately better scores
- Maximum distance: 5000 meters (5km)
- **Score Multipliers** (applied after base score calculation):
  - Location 3 (id: 2): **x2 multiplier** (doubles the base score)
  - Locations 4-5 (id: 3-4): **x3 multiplier** (triples the base score)
  - Locations 1-2 (id: 0-1): No multiplier (base score only)
- Maximum possible total score: 1000 points (100 + 100 + 200 + 300 + 300)

### Share Message Generation
```javascript
function generateShareMessage()
function getScoreEmoji(score)
async function shareScore()
```
- Generates formatted share message with URL, date, scores, and emojis
- Maps scores to appropriate emojis
- Uses Clipboard API or native Share API

### Location Progression
```javascript
function getCurrentLocation()
function updateCurrentLocationDisplay(animate)
function advanceToNextLocation()
function makeGuess(tapLatLng)
```
- Manages sequential location display
- Handles animations and transitions
- Prevents skipping locations
- Updates UI and game state

### Transition Guard (Critical for Mobile)
```javascript
let isTransitioning = false;
let transitionTimeoutId = null;
let displayUpdateTimeoutId = null;
```
- **CRITICAL**: The `isTransitioning` flag MUST be set to `true` immediately after the guard check in `makeGuess()`, BEFORE the `setTimeout()` call
- Prevents location skipping during rapid taps on mobile devices
- Blocks new guesses while a transition is in progress
- Clears existing timeouts before starting new transitions to prevent overlaps
- **Regression Prevention**: Tests verify the flag is set before setTimeout to prevent this bug from recurring
- Transition duration: 500ms fade-out + 2100ms overlay = 2600ms total

### Game State Structure
```javascript
{
  currentLocationIndex: number,  // Current location being guessed (0-4)
  guesses: {
    [locationId]: {
      latlng: { lat: number, lng: number },  // User's guess coordinates
      distance: number,                      // Distance in meters
      score: number                          // Score 0-100
    }
  },
  totalScore: number                         // Sum of all scores (0-1000 with multipliers)
}
```

### localStorage Key Format
- Key: `phillyGame_${today.toDateString()}`
- Example: `phillyGame_Tue Jan 17 2025`
- Value: JSON stringified gameState
- Resets automatically each day

## Location Configuration

Locations are defined in `config/locations.yaml` file. The file supports:

1. **Default locations**: Used when no specific date match is found
2. **Date-specific locations**: Format `YYYY-MM-DD` as keys for specific dates

### Current Location Sets

The game includes location sets for:
- **Default locations**: Fallback set used when no date-specific match exists
- **January 2025**: Daily location sets for January 18-31, 2025 (14 days)
- **Current date**: Location set for today (2026-01-17)

### Difficulty Progression

Each day's locations are organized by difficulty, with `id` indicating difficulty level:

- **Location 0 (Easiest)**: Most Philadelphians should be able to identify these well-known landmarks
  - Examples: Rocky Steps, Love Park, South Street, Rittenhouse Square, Ben Franklin Bridge, Spruce Street Harbor Park
- **Location 1 (~10% accuracy)**: Well-known but more specific locations that about 10% of players get close to
  - Examples: Monk's Cafe, Bob & Barbara's, Jim's Steaks, Pat's King of Steaks, Dirty Frank's
- **Locations 2-4 (Hardest)**: Progressively more challenging locations
  - Location 2: Museums, popular attractions (Franklin Institute, Eastern State Penitentiary, Magic Gardens)
  - Location 3: Historic houses, cemeteries, specialized institutions (Powel House, Laurel Hill Cemetery, Barnes Foundation)
  - Location 4 (Hardest): Lesser-known historic sites, specialized venues, outlying areas (Wagner Free Institute, Stenton Mansion, Bartram's Garden)

### Location Types

Locations include a diverse mix of:
- **Landmarks**: Rocky Steps, Love Park, South Street, Ben Franklin Bridge, Boathouse Row
- **Bars & Restaurants**: Monk's Cafe, Bob & Barbara's, McGillin's Olde Ale House, Jim's Steaks, Pat's/Geno's
- **Parks & Outdoor Spaces**: Rittenhouse Square, Washington Square, Spruce Street Harbor Park, Wissahickon Valley
- **Museums & Cultural Sites**: Philadelphia Museum of Art, Franklin Institute, Mutter Museum, Magic Gardens, Barnes Foundation
- **Historic Buildings**: Independence Hall, Betsy Ross House, Powel House, Elfreth's Alley
- **Cemeteries**: Laurel Hill Cemetery, Woodlands Cemetery, Mt. Moriah Cemetery
- **Specialized Institutions**: Wagner Free Institute of Science, Please Touch Museum, Academy of Natural Sciences
- **Intersections & Districts**: Chinatown Gate, Market East Station, Old City District

### Uniqueness Requirement

All locations are unique across the entire configuration - no location appears twice in the same file. This ensures variety and prevents repetition.

### YAML Structure

```yaml
default:
  - id: 0
    name: Liberty Bell
    coordinates: [39.9496, -75.1503]

## Deployment

**Live Site**: https://briengleason.github.io/philly-fingered/

**Platform**: GitHub Pages (static hosting)

### Auto-Sync Setup

1. **Post-commit hook**: Automatically pushes after each `git commit`
2. **Pre-commit hook**: Runs tests before allowing commit
3. **Manual sync script**: Run `./scripts/sync-to-github.sh` anytime

See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `docs/GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

## Maintenance

### Updating Locations
Edit `config/locations.yaml` file:

1. **Update default locations**: Modify the `default:` section
2. **Add date-specific locations**: Add a new date key (YYYY-MM-DD format)

**Difficulty Guidelines:**
- **Location 0 (id: 0)**: Should be easily identifiable by most Philadelphians (major landmarks, popular spots)
- **Location 1 (id: 1)**: Well-known but more specific (~10% of players should get close)
- **Locations 2-4 (id: 2-4)**: Progressively harder (museums, historic sites, specialized venues, outlying areas)

**Requirements:**
- All locations must be unique (no duplicates within the file)
- Each day should have 5 locations (id 0-4)
- Locations should progress from easiest (0) to hardest (4)
- Mix of location types: landmarks, bars, restaurants, parks, museums, historic sites

Example:
```yaml
2025-01-20:
  - id: 0
    name: South Street
    coordinates: [39.9419, -75.1536]
    icon: 🎸
  - id: 1
    name: Jim's Steaks
    coordinates: [39.9419, -75.1658]
    icon: 🥩
  - id: 2
    name: Magic Gardens
    coordinates: [39.9428, -75.1597]
    icon: 🎨
  - id: 3
    name: Woodlands Cemetery
    coordinates: [39.9486, -75.2047]
    icon: 🌳
  - id: 4
    name: 30th Street Station
    coordinates: [39.9556, -75.1819]
    icon: 🚂
```

The app automatically loads the correct locations based on today's date.

### Changing Scoring
Modify `MAX_DISTANCE` (default: 5000 meters) and `calculateScore()` function in `index.html`.
To change multipliers, update the `applyScoreMultiplier()` logic in `makeGuess()` function.

### Preventing Regressions

#### Mobile Transition Bug (Location Skipping)
**Problem**: Locations 2 and 4 (indices 1 and 3) were being skipped during rapid taps on mobile.

**Root Cause**: The `isTransitioning` flag was not set to `true` before the `setTimeout()` call, allowing multiple simultaneous transitions.

**Fix**: 
1. Set `isTransitioning = true` immediately after the guard check
2. Clear existing timeouts before starting new transitions
3. Properly manage timeout IDs for cleanup

**Prevention**:
- Tests verify the flag is set BEFORE setTimeout (see `Transition guard: isTransitioning must be set BEFORE setTimeout` test)
- Tests verify rapid fire calls are blocked (see `Transition guard: rapid fire calls should only process first` test)
- Tests verify timeout clearing prevents overlaps (see `Transition guard: timeout clearing prevents overlapping transitions` test)
- **CRITICAL**: When modifying `makeGuess()` or `advanceToNextLocation()`, ensure `isTransitioning = true` is set immediately after the guard check, before any async operations

**Test Coverage**: 5+ tests specifically target this bug to prevent regression.

### Styling
All CSS is embedded in `<style>` tag in `index.html`.

## Git Workflow

- **Main branch**: `main`
- **Auto-sync**: Post-commit hook pushes to GitHub
- **Test enforcement**: Pre-commit hook runs tests before commit
- **Manual sync**: Run `./scripts/sync-to-github.sh`

## Key Bug Fixes & Improvements

### Location Skipping Bug
- **Issue**: Locations 2 and 4 were being skipped during sequential display
- **Root Cause**: Variable name conflict and incorrect index management
- **Fix**: Used temporary `nextIndex` variable and proper loop logic
- **Result**: All locations now display sequentially without skipping

### Share Button Not Working
- **Issue**: Share button did nothing when clicked
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript functions (`getScoreEmoji`, `generateShareMessage`, `shareScore`) were missing
- **Fix**: Added all three functions to implement share functionality
- **Result**: Share button now copies formatted message to clipboard

### Map Container Test Failing
- **Issue**: Test failed on test page (no map container present)
- **Root Cause**: Test asserted map exists without checking if container is present
- **Fix**: Added graceful skip when container doesn't exist
- **Result**: Test skips appropriately in different environments
